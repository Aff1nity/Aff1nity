### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

 I'm originally from Argentina, but I've been living in Sweden since December 2019. My professional background includes working as an English teacher and assistant teacher at my university back in Argentina. Teaching English provided me with the ability to present and deliver a variety of topics in a way that is accessible and engaging for students. This involves effective communication skills and the ability to tailor instruction to the needs and interests of individual learners. As an English teacher, I have developed these skills and gained experience in helping students achieve their language learning goals.

In Sweden, I've been working in customer service since April 2020, however now with a focus on payments and transactions.

My passions include learning and reading. Currently, I'm studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) exam, and I'm also working on improving my skills in Python, data engineering, and data analysis during my free time. I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and improve my current skills, as well as develop new ones.

On my GitHub profile, you'll find various projects and code snippets related to my interests and studies. Feel free to browse through my repositories and leave feedback or suggestions. Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful or interesting!
